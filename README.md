## Week39 review
This repo contains part 1, 2 and 3.

Rest endpoints tested in postman - Rest assured done for some of the methods.

Branch called part 3 contains the address feature where a person gets an address.

Week 39 assignments uploaded to two different repos since we needed to branch out for part 1, 2 and 3.

## Below is the link to the repo from 22/9 where we need to code along some videos from Jon.
